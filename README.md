Question 1 - An exercise in sorting

Implemented the AlphabaticOrder function which will accept inputString and remove all special characters and sort by list of letters.

InputString will be any string that you want to sort by. 


Question 2 - Conway’s Game of Life

Implemented the GameOfLifeBoard function which will accept Heigh, Width and MaxRuns as parameters and it will display the board as per the input values. 



Create a Unit Test project and implemented the test method to test AlphabaticOrder.
